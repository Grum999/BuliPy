# BuliPy

A plugin for [Krita](https://krita.org).


## What is BuliPy?
*BuliPy* is a Python plugin made for [Krita](https://krita.org) (free professional and open-source painting program).

The *BuliPy* plugin is an alternative to *Scripter* plugin which is provided by default with [Krita](https://krita.org).

It try provides a different user interface and some additional functionnalities
I use *Scripter* a lot, it's an interesting tool to code and test Krita's dedicated snippets but there's some really boring stuff for me:
- The boring <kbd>Esc</kbd> key
- The boring window still opened when Krita is closes
- Lost work on crash ðŸ˜…
- No search & replace
- ...

The *BuliPy* tries to provides an advanced functionnalities.

## Functionalities

<details>
<summary>File management</summary>

### Open & Save document

File dialog to open & save document provide a quick preview (with syntax highlighting) of file content:

![Open file dialog](./screenshots/r0.1.0_openfile.jpeg)

When you have a lot of snippet/test documents, this allows to quickly check which one you want to open.


### File cache
All change made on a document are automatically saved in a cache?
If *BuliPy* is closed (Closed, Krita closed, big crash), on next start you'll get your unsaved document back.


### Multiple opened files
Multiple documents can be opened.
Switch from one to another one with *tabs* or *Document docker*.

> *Note*
> - Blue bullet on *tab* means the document has been modified and not saved
>
>   ![Open file dialog](./screenshots/r0.1.0_doctabs.jpeg)

### External change detection
Modification made on opened document outside *BuliPy* are detected, and user informed about what to do:

![Multiple opened documents tabs](./screenshots/r0.1.0_docexternalmodif.jpeg)

> *Notes*
> - Red bullet on *tab* means the document has been modified outside editor
> - Document is automatically switched to read-only mode unless user decide for an action

### Recents files
Menu *File* > *Recents* provide access to last opened/closed documents.

> - Tool need some improvement, check plugin's ***Whatâ€™s next?*** section

### Quick Krita API

Krita's documentation embedded in a docker, allowing quick search from Class and/or Method name.


![Color picker example](./screenshots/r0.1.0_tool_quickkritaapi.jpeg)

| Ref. | Description |
| --- | --- |

| 2 | Expoand/Collapse all classes |

> *Notes*
> - Tool tries to provides a more readable information than one provided on official [Krita's API](https://api.kde.org/krita/html/) site which is:
>   - Hard to read especially since it has been moved to KDE api hosting
>   - Oriented to C developpers (Doxygen generate document from C, then using C definition and types, ...)
> - Documentation is built from scratch from Krita source code (.h files) with a dedicated *BuliBy* internal script; then generated documentation:
>   - Is Python oriented (use python syntax and types instead of C)
>   - Is able to provide from which Krita version a class/method has been implemented the first time, and updated for the last time


### Files properties to clipboard

Menu *Tools* > *Copy to clipboard* let you copy to clipboard current file properties:
- Full path/file name
- Path name

Open *Krita Scripting School* website in browser.

### PyKrita Python definition for IDE
If your IDE support Python language and can interpret python files, you can download [krita.py](https://github.com/Grum999/BuliPy/blob/main/bulipy/bulipy/bp/resources/docs/krita.py) from repository and use it for your IDE.

## Download, Install & Execute

### Download
+ **[ZIP ARCHIVE - v0.1.0b](https://github.com/Grum999/BuliPy/releases/download/0.1.0b/bulipy.zip)**
+ **[SOURCE](https://github.com/Grum999/BuliPy)**

### Installation

Plugin installation in [Krita](https://krita.org) is not intuitive and needs some manipulation:

1. Open [Krita](https://krita.org) and go to **Tools** -> **Scripts** -> **Import Python Plugins...** and select the **bulipy.zip** archive and let the software handle it.
2. Restart [Krita](https://krita.org)
3. To enable *BuliPy* go to **Settings** -> **Configure Krita...** -> **Python Plugin Manager** and click the checkbox to the left of the field that says **BuliPy**.
4. Restart [Krita](https://krita.org)

### Execute

Once installed, simply go to menu **Tools**, **BuliPy** entry should be available.
It's possible to affect a shortcut to plugin through Krita's shortcuts configuration dialog.

### Tested platforms

Plugin requires at least Krita 5.2.0 (Linux appimage)
Not tested on windows & MacOs

## Plugin's life

### What's new?

_[2023-10-04] Version 0.1.0b_ *[Show detailed release content](./releases-notes/RELEASE-0.1.0b.md)*
- First implemented/released version!


### Bugs

Maybe boring but probably not blocking.

Since krita 5.2, for some user like me, typing dead keys like circumflex character `^` doesn't work anymore: if you have the problem, it's not related to plugin
> A [bug](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=469691) has been opened on Krita side for this case...


### Whatâ€™s next?

> ***BuliPy* plugin is not an IDE**
> Even if it provides more functionnalities than default *Scripter*, it's not the goal to have a complete IDE ðŸ™‚

Some stuff I still have to implement
- Improve search (search next, pre-fill search text with current selected text)
- Split window (view mutliple document at the same time)
- Theme editor (let user define is own color syntax setup)
- Theme integration (currently 'dark' themes are supported, 'light' themes are partially supported)
- Manipulate document: filter from rules
- Manipulate document: Pretiffy function for JSON/XML

Some functionalities I may or maynot implement, according to my availability:
- Code folding
- Block/Column mode selection
- Debugger with breakpoint
- Allows user to define own shortcut mapping keys

Some functionalities I will probably not implement:
- Linter
- Auto-completion
